# API Documentation

Last Updated: May 16, 2025

Integrate Gofile's powerful storage and content delivery capabilities into your applications with our REST API.

### BETA Status

üß™ This API is currently in BETA and may undergo changes and improvements. We recommend checking this documentation regularly for updates and new features.

### Authentication

All API requests require an API token for authentication. Include your token in the request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Get your API token from your [profile page](https://gofile.io/myprofile).

**Premium Requirement:** Most API endpoints require a premium account. Only basic operations like uploading, creating folders, and removing content are accessible with free accounts.

### Rate Limits

Rate limits are enforced on a per-endpoint basis. When exceeded, requests will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

For security reasons, specific rate limit values are not publicly disclosed. Normal API usage should not trigger these limits.

‚ö†Ô∏è Repeatedly exceeding rate limits may result in automatic IP bans.

üí° Need higher limits for your use case? [Contact our support team](https://gofile.io/contact) to discuss custom solutions.

### Account Structure

Each account is assigned a permanent root folder that serves as the base for all content organization:

Account ‚Üí Root Folder ‚Üí Contents (Files & Subfolders)

All files and subfolders must exist within this root structure. The root folder cannot be deleted or moved.

## Endpoints

**POST**`https://upload.gofile.io/uploadfile`

------

Upload files directly using our global upload endpoint.

‚ÑπÔ∏è When uploading without parameters, the system will:

- Create a guest account
- Generate a new public folder in the root directory
- Upload the file to this folder

#### Regional Upload Endpoints

`upload.gofile.io` Automatic (Closest Region)

`upload-eu-par.gofile.io` Europe (Paris)

`upload-na-phx.gofile.io` North America (Phoenix)
